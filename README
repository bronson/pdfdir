Joins a bunch of PDFs files in a directory hierarchy into a single pdf.

pdfdir-join expects each chapter to be in a separate pdf file.  It easily
assembles them into a book, complete with bookmarks (bookmarks are Adobe's
name for the the table of contents navigation in most PDF readers).


requires: Ghostscript, JPdfBookmarks

If you arrange your files in a hierarchy, like this:

    book / 01-Introduction.pdf
    book / 02-Engine
    book / 02-Engine / 01-Oil.pdf
    book / 02-Engine / 01-Freeze Plugs.pdf

    The "01-", "02-" etc determines the order of the chapters in the
    final book.  They will not appear in the bookmark name.

Then run the script:

    $ pdfdir-join book

you will find the result in "book.pdf"

Too easy!


To quickly discover if any PDFs are corrupt:

    $ pdfdir-verify book

By default this uses Ghostscript to carefully process every page of every PDF.
This is awfully slow so you can specify --quick for a 10X speedup at the risk
of missing some obscure corruptions.


If you're having trouble with encrypted or corrupt PDFs, try using
pdfdir-copy to create a duplicate of your entire directory structure.
 It takes a while but, because it re-encodes each PDF with ghostscript,
this ensures that the result is valid.

    $ pdfdir-copy book /tmp/book-fixed
