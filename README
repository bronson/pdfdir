Joins a bunch of PDF files in a directory hierarchy into a single pdf.
Creates a bookmark to each file (bookmarks are the table of contents
found in the sidebar of most PDF readers).


If you arrange your PDF files in a hierarchy, like this:

    book / 01-Introduction.pdf
    book / 02-Engine
    book / 02-Engine / 01-Coolant.pdf
    book / 02-Engine / 02-Freeze Plugs.pdf

    (the "01-", "02-" prefixes determine the order of the chapters in the
    final book.  They will not appear in the bookmarks.)

Then run the script:

    $ pdfdir-join book

you will find the result in "book.pdf"

Too easy!


requires: Ghostscript, JPdfBookmarks

pdfdir comes with a few utilites to help create good input files.


To quickly discover if any PDFs are corrupt:

    $ pdfdir-verify book

This uses Ghostscript to carefully process every page of every PDF.
This is awfully slow so you can specify --quick for a 10X speedup
at the risk of missing some obscure corruptions.


And, if you're having trouble with encrypted or corrupt PDFs, try using
pdfdir-copy to create a duplicate of your entire directory structure.
 It takes a while but, because it re-encodes each PDF with ghostscript,
this ensures that the result is valid.

    $ pdfdir-copy book /tmp/book-fixed
