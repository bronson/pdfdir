Joins a bunch of PDFs files in a directory hierarchy into a single pdf,
complete with bookmarks to each file.

If you put each chapter in its own PDF file, this easily assembles all
the chapters into a book, complete with bookmarks (the index / table of
contents found in the sidebar).


requires: Ghostscript, JPdfBookmarks

You arrange your files in a hierarchy, like this:

    book / 01-Introduction.pdf
    book / 02-Engine
    book / 02-Engine / 01-Oil.pdf
    book / 02-Engine / 01-Freeze Plugs.pdf

The "01-", "02-" etc just determine the order of the chapters in the
final book.  They will not appear in the bookmark name.

Then just run the script:

    $ pdfdir-join book

And find the result in "book.pdf"

Easy!


If you're having trouble with encrypted or corrupt PDFs, try copying
everything.  It takes a while but it ensures that ghostscript can work
with all the resulting PDFs.

    $ pdfdir-copy book /tmp/book-fixed


To discover if any PDFs are corrupt:

    $ pdfdir-verify book

By default this uses Ghostscript to process every page of every PDF.
That's quite slow.  Specify --quick for a massive speedup at the risk
of missing some obscure corrupted PDFs.
