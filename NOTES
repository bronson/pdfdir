  Looks like I can support the Platypus progress bar.

Make it support reprocessing images.

Rewrite in Ruby so it's maintainable again.
  (or rust...?)
  NO: rewrite the Ruby to be shell!
    Ask someone else to do this...?

To not reprocess images: https://superuser.com/questions/360216/use-ghostscript-but-tell-it-to-not-reprocess-images
  (except that this is 8 years ago)
  And I don't see ghostscript reprocessing by default...
    but maybe there are site settings I should override.

 add a pdef-split script, that does the opposite of pdef-join?
